# Estrus-Playback-Experiments-with-Male-African-Elephants

Scripts and publicly available data files used for the statistical analyses for a study on how male African elephants respond to pre-recorded estrus calls in Etosha National Park, Namibia. Due to an ongoing hormone study for this population, testosterone data is only available upon reasonable request.

The scripts below can be used to replicate all statistical modeling and conclusions reported in the manuscript of our study, "Reproductive Motivations in Male African Elephants May Serve as a Tool in Conflict Mitigation," recently submitted to the MDPI's Animals journal for a special issue on elephant communication.

Authors: Caitlin E. O'Connell-Rodwell, Monica N. Sandri, Jodie L. Berezin, Jaquelyn M. Munevar, Colleen Kinzley, Joyce H. Poole, and Jason D. Wood

Questions regarding the data or scripts can be directed to: Monica N. Sandri at monica.n.sandri[at]gmail.com

Thanks, and enjoy!
