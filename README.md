# Estrous-Playback-Experiments-with-Male-African-Elephants

Scripts and publicly available data files used for the statistical analyses for a study on how male African elephants respond to pre-recorded estrous calls in Etosha National Park, Namibia. Due to an ongoing hormone study for this population, raw testosterone data has not yet been made publicly available.

The scripts below can be used to replicate all statistical modeling and conclusions reported in the manuscript of our study, "Age and Hormonally Driven Responses of Male African Ele-phants (_Loxodonta africana_) to Estrous Call Playbacks May Inform Conservation Management Tools," recently submitted to the MDPI's Animals journal for a special issue on elephant communication.

Authors: Caitlin E. O'Connell-Rodwell, Monica N. Sandri, Jodie L. Berezin, Jaquelyn M. Munevar, Colleen Kinzley, Jason D. Wood, Maggie Wisniewska, and Werner Kilian 

Questions regarding the data or scripts can be directed to: Monica N. Sandri at monica.n.sandri[at]gmail.com and Jodie L. Berezin at jberezin[at]smith.edu.

Thanks, and enjoy!
